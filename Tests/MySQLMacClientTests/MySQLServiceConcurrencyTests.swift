/// Regression coverage for a real bug found while manually testing the app:
/// switching tables quickly closed the connection with "MySQL error:
/// Connection closed". Root cause was that `MySQLService` was an actor with
/// a single `await` per query — actors are reentrant, so a second call
/// could start sending a command on the wire while a prior call was still
/// suspended waiting for its response, desyncing MySQL's non-pipelined wire
/// protocol. The fix serializes access with a FIFO gate inside the actor;
/// these tests fire concurrent queries the way rapid table-switching does,
/// against the real local MariaDB — not a mock.
